# NoMoreRansom
All-in-One Ransomware Decryption Tools

> The general advice is not to pay the ransom. By sending your money to cybercriminals you’ll only confirm that ransomware works, and there’s no guarantee you’ll get the decryption key you need in return.

All credit goes to the [No More Ransom project](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html) (more information and how-to guides are available there). Other tools not found in the aforementioned page were discovered from various other reliable online sources/websites (such as [Avast](https://www.avast.com/ransomware-decryption-tools), [AVG](https://now.avg.com/avg-offers-free-ransomware-decryptor-tools-for-businesses), [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs), [Emsisoft](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/free-download), [Kaspersky](https://noransom.kaspersky.com/), [CERT.PL](https://nomoreransom.cert.pl/), [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/windows/ransomware-decryptors/), etc). This is simply an unofficial mirror compilation repository for all of those tools. Some tools are designed to be able to decrypt files affected by multiple ransomware strains/variants.

Before running anything, please consult accordingly with either the associated how-to guide PDF files or any reliable online guide articles from the official websites of those who provided the decryptors. Some additional helpful websites:

- [Kaspersky's General Articles on Recovery Tools](https://support.kaspersky.com/common/disinfection)
- [Bleeping Computer's Articles on Ransomware Decryptors](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/ransomware/decryptor/)
- [CERT Polska's Vortex Ransomware Detector Tool](https://vortex.cert.pl/) (in Polish language)
- [AES Crypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/download/)

For ransomware recognition tools, there are also several tools available as an online service:

- [No More Ransom's Crypto Sheriff](https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php)
- [ID Ransomware by MalwareHunterTeam](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/)
- [Emsisoft's Ransomware Detection Tool](https://www.emsisoft.com/ransomware-decryption-tools/) (service also provided by [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/))

Also, a gentle reminder that not every type of ransomware has a solution. While I will attempt to regularly update this repository with new applications when available, the best solution for any ransomware is to not get infected in the first place. Always be vigilant on the Internet!

## Disclaimer

License agreement and copyright for each tool provided here depend on their respective creators and all of these tools belong to their creators/authors. I do not own or claim any ownership over any of the tools available here. I am also not affiliated with any of the companies, parties, institutions, agencies, partners, etc. involved in the official No More Ransom project or any authors of the tools provided here. This is just to help those people out there who need a quick solution to ransomware file decryption.

## Safety/Security

Please don't just blindly trust me (I am just a random person on the Internet, after all) and ensure that you actually check each decryptor executable that you would like to run first by using any reliable antivirus tool (either online such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) or any other downloadable/installable antivirus tools). Before you decrypt any files, ensure that you have removed the corresponding malware from your system first. Otherwise, it will repeatedly lock your system or encrypt files. Any reliable antivirus solution can do this for you. I am not responsible for any breakage/problems to your computer system/files/data if you decide to use/misuse/abuse these executables.

## Future To-Do List
- Add instruction manuals and how-to guides (need to figure out how to include guides that are published in the form of online webpages, instead of PDF files).
- Update with more decryptors as more ransomwares are created.
